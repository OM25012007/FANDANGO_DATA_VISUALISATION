# <u>** Fandango Movie Ratings Analysis**</u>

A comprehensive data analysis project examining movie rating discrepancies and potential bias in Fandango's rating system compared to other major review platforms.

## Project Overview

This project analyzes movie ratings from various platforms to investigate potential rating inflation on Fandango, a popular movie ticket purchasing website. The analysis explores rating distributions, correlations between different review sites, and visualizes patterns in movie scoring across platforms.

##  Objectives

- Analyze rating distributions across different movie review platforms
- Investigate potential bias or inflation in Fandango's rating system
- Compare Fandango ratings with other major review sites (Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic, IMDB)
- Identify patterns and discrepancies in movie scoring
- Visualize rating correlations and distributions
- Provide insights into the reliability of different rating platforms

##  Dataset Description

**Datasets Used:**
- `all_sites_scores.csv` - Comprehensive movie ratings from multiple platforms
- `fandango_scrape.csv` - Scraped Fandango ratings data
